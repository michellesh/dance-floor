# Arduino Code

## Set up WiFi credentials

Copy the `WiFiCredentials` library to your Arduino libraries directory. Replace `/path/to/sketchbook` with your Arduino sketchbook location (found in Arduino preferences)
```
cp -r arduino/libraries/WiFiCredentials/ /path/to/sketchbook/libraries/WiFiCredentials
```

Open `/path/to/sketchbook/libraries/WiFiCredentials/WiFiCredentials.h` and fill in your router's ssid and password.
